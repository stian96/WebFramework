# Webframework
This framework was created for a Framework course at Ã˜stfold University College. The framework uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) v3.8 as a build and dependency managment tool. For web communication, we have chosen to use [Java servlet](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.servlet/servlet-api) v3.1 and the [Jetty-library](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) to handle the request/response workflow. Java is the main language that has been used to develop the framework, but we have also used [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/) and some Javascript for developing a realtime chatroom service. 

### Background
The purpose of the framework is to develop a specially adapted platform for developing simple web applications that include the following functional areas:
* application
* Frontend
* Database
* security
* Backend

The web framework will contain functionality that simplifies development processes by automating some of the common tasks that developers face in these areas.

### Purpose
The aim of the framework is to simplify the development of webapplications by making some of the development parts easier. We want to achieve this by offering a framework that gives developers access to a number of functionalities that are relevant to the aformentioned areas.
